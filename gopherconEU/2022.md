# My GopherConEU 2022 experience

A week has passed since GopherConEU 2022, held in July 28th to 31st, and I wish to share with you my experience of these amazing conference days and the content of what was said in the various talks.

_TL;DR_: it was great to be back in person, meet new Gophers, hearing a lot of interesting talks and speaking for the first time.

## Let's start

GopherConEU 2022 was composed of several days: a community event, the workshop day and a two days run of talks. My participation was limited to the two days of talks but I sure felt the great energy and friendly atmosphere that sourrounds the Go community. Everyone was eager to exchange and learn about Go, either on specific topics or on the general trends.

Every edition of GopherConEU, this being the 5th, has been organized in a different location, Iceland and the Canary islands to name a few; this year's edition was organized in Berlin in the Festsaal Kreuzberg.

But let's go in order.

## Talks: day 1

Day 1 of the talks was composed of two kinds of talks:

- Practical uses of Go
- Interventions from the Go team

A good talk to start with was the one about CLIs by Marian Montagnino: for those like me who love using CLIs (often much more thank UIs) this talk gave a lot of insights on how to make a CLI _closer to the user_ rather than the machine
