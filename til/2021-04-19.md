# Today I Learned: Shell find and loops

Today I learned a situation in which is good to use a __for loop__ in a shell in moments when the __-exec__ flag alone is difficult to use.

The __find__ command in any case is very powerful and can assist in many shell tasks. Usually when executing commands on a set of file the `find` command, together with the `-exec` expression in the `find $PATH -exec $COMMAND {} \;` instruction, is very useful to write short and meaningful operations like

```bash
find ./ -name $PATTERN -exec cat {} \;
```

to print the content of a list of files denoted by the _PATTERN_ variable.

However, it is not very useful when the situation gets complex like in this scenario.

Suppose we have 2 files:

1. _file1_ with content

    > -l

2. _file2_ with content

    > -a

And we want to run `ls` with the options found in these files.

In this context the command

```bash
find ./ -name "file*" -exec ls $(cat {}) \;
```

would not work (the error would be "_cat: {}: No such file or directory_").

In this situation a classic __for range__ loop will help us achieve this goal. As in this example

```bash
for i in $(find ./ -name "file*"); do ls $(cat $i); done
```

Despite being very unconventional uses of those instructions, I propose these examples to draw a line on where the `find` command manages to do the job alone and where it is more helpful to include its resuls it in a `for range` loop.

Hope this was helpful, thanks a lot for your time reading it!
