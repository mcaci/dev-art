## Meaning of the `.PHONY` target inside a Makefile

Inside the `Makefile` of a project you can find a `.PHONY` element followed by a label and then the same label used as a [target](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Rules.html#index-target) for the Makefile.

For example:

```Makefile
.PHONY: build
build:
        go build
```

`.PHONY` is actually itself a target for the `make` commandand and it denotes labels that do not represent files of the project. What does it mean?

In the general case, assuming that there are no files called __build__ in the project, when not using the `.PHONY` target, like so

```Makefile
build:
        go build
```

everytime the `make build` command is invoked it will execute the specified command (in this case `go build`). However, if there was a file named __build__, the `make build` would be bound by the presence of this file and executed only if that file was updated.

The `.PHONY` target overrides this last behaviour and let's the `make build` execute no matter of the presence of a file named __build__.

For a more in-depth overview head to the `make` command [reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html).
