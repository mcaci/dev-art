## How to run commands using SSH

On your UNIX or Linux terminal you may use the `ssh` command to connect to a distant server/machine and start a new session there. While connected to this session, you may run all the commands you have permission to run in that server/machine but what if you wanted to run these commands but still staying in your starting session?

If to connect to a machine with `$IP_ADDR` as ip address and with `$USERNAME` as user you run `ssh $USERNAME@$IP_ADDR` to run a command in that machine as the aforementioned user you can run __`ssh $USERNAME@$IP_ADDR 'cmd'`__ which can be any command like `ls`, `pwd`, `whoami` and so on. Quotation marks `''` are not mandatory but in my opinion they help to clearly identify what command you intend to run.

A practical (even if a bit cheaty) example:

```bash
$ ssh mcaci@localhost 'whoami' # "ssh mcaci@localhost whoami" would give the same result
...
mcaci@localhost's password: 
mcaci
```
