## How to create an orphan branch in git

Sometimes you may need to create a brand new branch on a git project that doesn't contain anything present on the other branches nor shares an history with them, called _orphan branch_.

This snippet describes how to do it:

```sh
BRANCH_NAME=$1
git checkout --orphan $BRANCH_NAME
git rm -rf .
rm .gitignore
echo "# $BRANCH_NAME" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit for branch $BRANCH_NAME"
git push origin $BRANCH_NAME
```

This snippet can be used as a sequence of commands, replacing `$1` with any value for the branch name, or in a bash script, for example naming it orphan_branch.sh and running it with `sh ./orphan_branch.sh new_branch_name`.

More information can be found in the git reference guide at the [git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#Documentation/git-checkout.txt---orphanltnewbranchgt) documentation.
