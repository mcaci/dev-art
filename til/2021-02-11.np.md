## How to run an instruction n times using a Ticker in Go

While exercising with __Ticker__ objects in Go I found out a nice way to combine it with a for loop to make a task being executed regularly (thanks to the `ticker.Ticker`'s properties) for a fixed amount of times.

Here is an example of creating player names, "Player1" to "Player5" every second.

```go
const (
    iterations = 5
    nSecs = 1
)

func playerNamer(names chan<- string) {
    defer close(names)
    ticker := time.NewTicker(nSecs * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    for i := 0; i < iterations; i++ {
        <-ticker.C
        names <- fmt.Sprintf("Player%d", i+1)
    }
}
```

Here we use the properties of the `for` loop to fix the amount of iterations that we want to run and the `ticker` variable to space the creation and sending of the name on the channel in intervals of 1 second.

As an alternative, we could write it also in the following way:

```go
const (
    iterations = 5
    nSecs = 1
)

func playerNamer(names chan<- string) {
    defer close(names)
    ticker := time.NewTicker(nSecs * time.Second)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    var i int
    for range ticker {
        if i >= iterations {
            break
        }
        names <- fmt.Sprintf("Player%d", i+1)
    }
}
```

But I argue the fact that this version, having more indentations, looks a bit less readable than the first example.

In both cases, since `names` is a __send-only__ channel and we don't need it after the function ends, we close this channel with a `defer` at the very first line in order to be assured that it won't be forgotten.

This can be useful when we know exactly how many times a regular task has to be performed.

I hope this little example was useful and, by the way, tickers also make an appearance in this small [example](https://dev.to/mcaci/how-to-use-the-context-done-method-in-go-22me) about `context.Context` in Go.
